## Modeling and Analysis of Four Databases
In this section, we have analyzed and modeled four databases. The databases include:

1. Thyroid: Patients with thyroid conditions
2. Housing: Characteristics of coastal houses
3. Diabetes: Patients with diabetes
4. Corona: COVID-19 patients

# Overview
Initial Analysis
##  Summarization: Provided a comprehensive summary of each dataset, highlighting key statistics and features.

## Visualization: Created various plots and charts to visualize the data distribution and identify patterns.

Handling Missing Data
##  Methods Used: Employed different techniques to handle missing data, including mode, mean, and imputation methods.

##  Imputation: Used advanced imputation techniques to fill in missing values, ensuring the integrity of the datasets.

Normalization
##  Standardization: Applied normalization techniques to standardize the data, making it suitable for modeling.

•  Scaling: Scaled the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

Outlier Detection
•  Identification: Identified outliers using statistical methods and visualization techniques.

•  Handling: Decided on appropriate actions for outliers, such as removal or transformation.

Chi-Square Test
•  Purpose: Conducted chi-square tests to examine the independence of categorical variables.

•  Results: Analyzed the results to understand the relationships between different variables.

Correlation Analysis
•  Examination: Examined the correlations between variables to identify significant relationships.

•  Heatmaps: Created correlation heatmaps to visualize the strength and direction of relationships.

Regression Analysis
•  House Prices: Predicted house prices using regression models, analyzing the impact of various features.

•  Blood Glucose Levels: Predicted blood glucose levels in diabetes patients, identifying key predictors.

Methods
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
•  Application: Applied KNN for classifying COVID-19 patients into categories such as deceased, recovered, and under treatment.

•  Performance: Evaluated the performance of the KNN model and fine-tuned parameters for optimal results.

These analyses were implemented separately in both R and Python, providing a comprehensive approach to data modeling and prediction.
