# Project Overview
In this section, we analyze four datasets and apply regression methods for predictions. The datasets include:

1. Thyroid: Patients with thyroid conditions
2. Housing: Coastal home characteristics
3. Diabetes: Patients with diabetes
4. Corona: COVID-19 patients
Steps in the Analysis
Initial Data Exploration:

Summarization and data visualization.
Handling Missing Data:

Filling missing values using various methods such as mode, mean, and imputation techniques.
Data Normalization.

Outlier Detection and Handling.

Chi-Square Test for independence.

Correlation Analysis:

Exploring relationships between variables.
Regression Analysis:

Predicting house prices and blood glucose levels related to diabetes using regression models.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification:

Applied to COVID-19 patient data for classification tasks.
