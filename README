Regression Analysis on Four Databases
In this section, we have analyzed four databases and performed predictions using regression methods. The databases include:

1. Thyroid: Patients with thyroid conditions
2. Housing: Characteristics of coastal houses
3. Diabetes: Patients with diabetes
4. Corona: COVID-19 patients

Overview
•  Initial Analysis: Summarization and visualization of the data

•  Handling Missing Data: Filled missing values using various methods such as mode, mean, and imputation

•  Normalization: Standardized the data

•  Outlier Detection: Identified and handled outliers

•  Chi-Square Test: Conducted chi-square tests

•  Correlation Analysis: Examined data correlations

•  Regression Analysis: Predicted house prices and blood glucose levels in diabetes patients using regression

Methods
•  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Applied KNN for COVID-19 patients

These analyses were implemented separately in both R and Python.
